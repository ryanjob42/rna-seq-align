# Data
This is the suggested location for your source genome FASTA file (the one you will be splitting and creating indexes of) and the genome annotations file (the .gtf file).
You can change the locations using the `config.yaml` file at the root of the repository, though.

It is also recommended you populate the FASTQ files you want to align in the `Inputs.tsv` file here.
Again, you can change the location or name of that file using the `config.yaml` file at the root of the repository.
